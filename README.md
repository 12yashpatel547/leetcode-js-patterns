# LeetCode JS Patterns 🚀

A comprehensive repository of LeetCode solutions organized by **Algorithmic Patterns**, implemented in **Semantic ES6+ JavaScript**. This project focuses on high-level technical interview preparation, prioritizing code readability, senior-level communication, and 2026 hiring standards.

## 🎯 The Philosophy

In a senior-level interview, "just making it pass" isn't enough. This repo enforces a higher standard:

* **Strict Semantic Naming:** No `i`, `j`, or `res`. We use `currentIndex`, `windowStart`, and `accumulatedTotal`.
* **The "Talk Track":** Every solution includes prompts on what to say out loud to your interviewer.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Categorizing problems by logic (e.g., Sliding Window) rather than data structure alone.
* **Mathematical Precision:** $O(n)$ complexity analysis using LaTeX for professional documentation.

## 🛠️ Solution Format

Every solution in this repository follows the **Senior Engineer Template**:

1.  **Title & Official LeetCode Link**
2.  **Complexity:** $O(n)$ Time and Space.
3.  **Key Intuition:** The core logic behind the pattern.
4.  **The Talk Track:** Phrases to guide the interviewer through your code.
5.  **Pseudocode:** Language-agnostic logic.
6.  **Semantic Solution:** Production-grade JavaScript code.
7.  **Dry Run:** Manual trace of a sample input to verify logic.
